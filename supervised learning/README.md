### Required libraries:
numpy 1.14.5
matplotlib 2.2.2
sklearn 0.19.0
scipy 1.1.0
pandas 0.23.4
	
### Data:
1. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.data
2. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/magic/magic04.data
	
### Code files:
The code has been split into four Jupyter Notebook file:

### Two Jupyter Notebooks perform gridsearch:
1. Gamma Telescope Dataset ML GridSearch.ipynb
2. Spambase Dataset ML GridSearch.ipynb

Two Jupyter Notebooks test the data on unseen test set and generate plots
1. Gamma Telescope Dataset ML Trials.ipynb
2. Spambase Dataset ML Trials.ipynb

### Running the code:
The Jupyter Notebooks are to be executed in the following order:
1. Gamma Telescope Dataset ML GridSearch.ipynb
2. Spambase Dataset ML GridSearch.ipynb
3. Gamma Telescope Dataset ML Trials.ipynb
4. Spambase Dataset ML Trials.ipynb

* To execute the notebooks, simply open them and go to Kernel -> Restart & Run All
* Datasets are downloaded directly when notebooks are executed
